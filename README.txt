EZ, just go into src and run Haunted Mansion Fullscreen.exe or Haunted Mansion Windowed.exe

This is the full game.

The reason I put it in a separate repo is because I'm not really proud of the design.

Everything is fully functional, everything works fine, its not the best game but its a game.

Ideally, I would've liked to include more objects, like for example a player class with an inventory, and
a better way of navigating through the house, but it just ended up being a bunch of if statements,
dont realy have and excuse for that other than it saved time (which is obviously no excuse).

Oh well, here's the final project
